- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    Inheritance helps me understand how object oriented programming works, specifically the relationships between classes. Having a "parent" class that can be extended to more specific classes is very useful for creating more complicated code.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    This assignment helped me better understand how inheritance can be used in my future coding projects, and I enjoyed learning about Hashtables (and going through all of the Hashtable methods). However, I had trouble finding a method that would properly work for the "isAvailable" section.
